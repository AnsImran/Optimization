#### This repository is still under construction.

#### Initially, I am compiling my works (Jupyter notebooks) completed during my studies in Physics (Bachelors / Masters) that are relevant to optimization.

#### Please note that when I completed these assignments, my programming skills were not very advanced. However, they have significantly improved since then. For my latest projects, please refer to: [General Machine Learning Capabilities](https://github.com/AnsImran/Classifying-Quasars-Galaxies-Stars-using-Photometry) or [Computer Vision](https://github.com/AnsImran/classifying-grapevine-varieties-using-images-of-grapevine-leaves)
